  <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>URLS4IRL</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, stores, and protects personal information when you use our software-as-a-service platform (the “Service”), which allows users to save, organize, and share URLs within collaborative spaces (“UTubs”).
  </p>
  <p>
    We take your privacy seriously and aim to be clear about what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can control it. This policy applies to information collected through the Service and related features.
  </p>

  <h2 id="definitions">2. Definitions</h2>
  <p>For this Privacy Policy the following terms have the meanings set out below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cookie</strong>: A small text file stored on your device to enable features, support functionality, or maintain session information.</li>
    <li><strong>Company</strong>: URLS4IRL.</li>
    <li><strong>Country</strong>: The jurisdiction in which URLS4IRL operates — the United States.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer</strong>: The individual or entity that creates an account to use the Service.</li>
    <li><strong>Device</strong>: Any internet-connected device (computer, tablet, phone) used to access the Service.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal Data</strong>: Information that identifies or can reasonably identify an individual, alone or combined with other information.</li>
    <li><strong>Service</strong>: The URLS4IRL platform, including tools that allow users to save, organize, tag, and collaboratively share URLs within UTubs.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party services</strong>: External services we may integrate with to provide functionality (for example, authentication providers such as Google, hosting, or infrastructure providers). URLS4IRL does not use third-party advertising or marketing partners.</li>
    <li><strong>Website</strong>: https://urls.4irl.app (or any successor domain).</li>
    <li><strong>You</strong>: The individual who accesses or uses the Service, whether for personal or organizational purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="collect">3. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect only the information necessary to operate, secure, and improve the Service.</p>

  <h3 id="personal">3.1 Personal Data</h3>
  <p>To create an account, we collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email address</strong> — used for authentication, account notices, and login features (including optional Google Sign-In).</li>
    <li><strong>Username</strong> — used for account creation, identification within UTubs, login, and display purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Password</strong> — stored in hashed form for account security and authentication.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note">If you sign in with Google, we only request the minimum OAuth scopes required for authentication (typically <code>openid email profile</code>). We receive the <strong>email address</strong> and — only if explicitly requested and used — the display name and profile image URL. We do not request phone numbers or physical addresses from Google.</p>
  <p>We do not collect names, phone numbers, physical addresses, payment data, contact lists, or other identifying information unless you voluntarily provide them (for example, in a support request).</p>

  <h3 id="usage">3.2 Usage Data</h3>
  <p>When you use the Service, we automatically collect technical and usage data for security and operational purposes. This may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>IP address (used for security and coarse geolocation only)</li>
    <li>Browser type and version</li>
    <li>Operating system</li>
    <li>Device type</li>
    <li>Referrer URL</li>
    <li>Pages or endpoints accessed and actions taken</li>
    <li>Timestamps of requests</li>
    <li>Basic error or crash information</li>
    <li>User agent streing hash (when submitting support requests)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Usage Data is stored in server logs and used for diagnostics, rate limiting, abuse prevention, and improving the Service.</p>

  <h3 id="cookies">3.3 Tracking Technologies and Cookies</h3>
  <p>We use cookies to provide essential functionality and limited in-house analytics.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Essential Session Cookie</strong> — required for authentication and session management. Typically expires on logout or after <strong>30 days</strong> of inactivity (server-side session expiry).</li>
    <li><strong>Cookie Banner Preference Cookie (non-HTTP)</strong> — stores your acknowledgment of the cookie notice. Retained for <strong>365 days</strong> to prevent the banner from reappearing after you've seen it. This cookie does not track behavior and contains no personal information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use advertising cookies, cross-site tracking cookies, third-party tracking cookies, beacons, marketing pixels, or tracking tags.</p>
  <p>You may disable cookies in your browser, but essential functionality (including login) may not work without them.</p>

  <h3 id="analytics">3.4 In-House Analytics</h3>
  <p>We process analytics in-house (no Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or similar). All analytics are fully anonymized and aggregated—we do not associate analytics data with user IDs, pseudonymous identifiers, cookies, or any information that could identify individual users. Collected analytics include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pages or features accessed</li>
    <li>Time spent on features</li>
    <li>General interaction patterns</li>
    <li>Aggregated usage statistics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Analytics data is not shared with third-party analytics providers and is used only to improve the Service.</p>

  <h3 id="notcollect">3.5 Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Physical addresses</li>
    <li>Phone numbers (unless you voluntarily provide one)</li>
    <li>Payment information</li>
    <li>Contact lists</li>
    <li>GPS or precise location data (we may infer a coarse region from IP)</li>
    <li>Biometric data</li>
    <li>Sensitive personal data</li>
    <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell personal data or share it with advertisers.</p>

  <h2 id="use">4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the data we collect only for the purposes necessary to operate, secure, and improve the Service. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Operating and maintaining the Service (authentication, session management).</li>
    <li>Providing core functionality (creating, storing, tagging, and sharing URLs within UTubs).</li>
    <li>Maintaining security, including fraud detection, rate limiting, and abuse prevention.</li>
    <li>Providing customer support and responding to inquiries. When you submit a contact form, we collect your message, associated User ID, browser type and version, operating system, device type, and a hash of your user agent string to help us provide technical support and improve our Service.</li>
    <li>Improving and developing the Service (in-house analytics and product optimization).</li>
    <li>Notifying you about important changes to the Service or this policy.</li>
    <li>Complying with legal obligations.</li>
    <li>Processing additional purposes with your explicit consent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or cross-context behavioral tracking.</strong></p>

  <h2 id="retention">5. Retention of Your Personal Data</h2>
  <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy, or as required by law. Typical retention periods (subject to change):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account data (email):</strong> retained until you delete your account or we terminate it for cause.</li>
    <li><strong>Server logs & Usage Data:</strong> retained for <strong>90 days</strong> by default for operational and security purposes; may be retained up to <strong>24 months</strong> if required to investigate abuse or comply with legal obligations.</li>
    <li><strong>Anonymized, aggregated analytics:</strong> retained indefinitely as these statistics cannot be linked to individual users.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact form submissions:</strong> retained up to <strong>24 months</strong> for support history and service improvement purposes. Messages are stored in our database along with associated technical metadata (browser type, OS, device, User ID, user agent hash).</li>
    <li>We will delete or anonymize data when it is no longer required for the purpose it was collected.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you request deletion of your account, we will remove your account data within a reasonable timeframe subject to legal or technical constraints; backups and logs may persist for a short time according to the retention schedule above.</p>

  <h2 id="transfer">6. Transfer of Your Personal Data</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored and processed in the United States. If you are located outside the U.S., by using the Service you consent to transfer of your data to the United States, where data protection laws may differ.</p>
