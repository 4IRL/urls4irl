When creating plans, always:

1. Create a markdown file in the @plans directory at project root level. If the @plans directory does not exist, create it.
2. The name of this document should be relevant to the feature being created
3. The file should contain a brief but complete summary of the feature being requested.
4. The file should contain a step by step list of steps needed to be complete, as well as a "finished: false" section.
5. Each step should contain a brief summary of what needs to occur to complete this step.
